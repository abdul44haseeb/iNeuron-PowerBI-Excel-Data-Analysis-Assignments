What do you mean by BI? Explain.

BI stands for Business Intelligence. It refers to the technologies, processes, and strategies used by organizations to collect, analyze, and present business information. The primary goal of BI is to help companies make informed decisions by providing insights into their operations, performance, and market trends. 


How Power-BI helps in BI, and how does it help Analysts? Explain.

Explain Descriptive analytics?

Descriptive analytics is the branch of data analysis that focuses on summarizing historical data to gain insights into past events and trends. Its primary goal is to answer the question: "What happened?" This form of analytics provides a fundamental understanding of how things have occurred and serves as the foundation for more advanced types of analytics, such as predictive and prescriptive analytics.


Explain Predictive analytics?

Predictive analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that leverages historical data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques to make predictions about future events or outcomes. Unlike descriptive analytics, which focuses on summarizing past data, predictive analytics aims to answer questions like "What is likely to happen next?" or "What will the future look like based on current and historical data?" It helps organizations and individuals make informed decisions and take proactive actions by forecasting potential scenarios and their associated probabilities.


Explain prescriptive analytics?

Prescriptive analytics is the most advanced form of analytics that builds upon descriptive and predictive analytics. While descriptive analytics summarizes historical data, and predictive analytics makes predictions about future events, prescriptive analytics goes a step further by not only predicting outcomes but also recommending actions to optimize those outcomes. In essence, it provides answers to the question: "What should we do about it?"
